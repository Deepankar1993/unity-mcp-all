# Unity Bridge Network Configuration Update
**Date**: 2025-01-25 11:39

## Session Overview
Started at: 2025-01-25 11:39
Goal: Update Unity MCP Bridge to support connections from WSL Claude Code and other MCP clients (Cursor, VS Code, Claude Desktop)

## Goals
1. ✅ Check current Unity bridge network binding configuration
2. ✅ Update Unity bridge to listen on 0.0.0.0 instead of localhost only
3. Enable connectivity from WSL-based Claude Code
4. Ensure compatibility with all MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code)

## Progress

### Network Binding Update
- **Issue**: Unity bridge was configured to listen only on `IPAddress.Loopback` (localhost/127.0.0.1)
- **Solution**: Changed to `IPAddress.Any` (0.0.0.0) to accept connections from all network interfaces
- **File Modified**: `UnityMcpBridge/Editor/UnityMcpBridge.cs`
  - Line 77: Changed from `new TcpListener(IPAddress.Loopback, unityPort)` to `new TcpListener(IPAddress.Any, unityPort)`
  - Line 80: Updated debug message to indicate listening on all interfaces

### Changes Made
```csharp
// Before:
listener = new TcpListener(IPAddress.Loopback, unityPort);
Debug.Log($"UnityMcpBridge started on port {unityPort}.");

// After:
listener = new TcpListener(IPAddress.Any, unityPort);
Debug.Log($"UnityMcpBridge started on 0.0.0.0:{unityPort} (all network interfaces).");
```

## Next Steps
- Unity Editor will need to reload scripts to apply the changes
- Test connection from WSL-based Claude Code
- Verify connectivity from other MCP clients
