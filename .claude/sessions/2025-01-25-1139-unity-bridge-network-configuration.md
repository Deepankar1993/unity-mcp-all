# Unity Bridge Network Configuration Update
**Date**: 2025-01-25 11:39

## Session Overview
Started at: 2025-01-25 11:39
Goal: Update Unity MCP Bridge to support connections from WSL Claude Code and other MCP clients (Cursor, VS Code, Claude Desktop)

## Goals
1. ✅ Check current Unity bridge network binding configuration
2. ✅ Update Unity bridge to listen on 0.0.0.0 instead of localhost only
3. Enable connectivity from WSL-based Claude Code
4. Ensure compatibility with all MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code)

## Progress

### Network Binding Update
- **Issue**: Unity bridge was configured to listen only on `IPAddress.Loopback` (localhost/127.0.0.1)
- **Solution**: Changed to `IPAddress.Any` (0.0.0.0) to accept connections from all network interfaces
- **File Modified**: `UnityMcpBridge/Editor/UnityMcpBridge.cs`
  - Line 77: Changed from `new TcpListener(IPAddress.Loopback, unityPort)` to `new TcpListener(IPAddress.Any, unityPort)`
  - Line 80: Updated debug message to indicate listening on all interfaces

### Changes Made
```csharp
// Before:
listener = new TcpListener(IPAddress.Loopback, unityPort);
Debug.Log($"UnityMcpBridge started on port {unityPort}.");

// After:
listener = new TcpListener(IPAddress.Any, unityPort);
Debug.Log($"UnityMcpBridge started on 0.0.0.0:{unityPort} (all network interfaces).");
```

## Next Steps
- Unity Editor will need to reload scripts to apply the changes
- Test connection from WSL-based Claude Code
- Verify connectivity from other MCP clients

### Update - 2025-01-25 11:47 AM
**Model**: Opus 4 - coding work

**Summary**: Port conflict issue reported - Port 6400 is already in use

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: UnityMcpBridge/Editor/UnityMcpBridge.cs (network binding change)
- Current branch: master (commit: 3ec7a84 update for wsl)

**Todo Progress**: 4 completed, 1 pending, 0 in progress
- ✓ Completed: Check current Unity bridge network binding configuration
- ✓ Completed: Update Unity bridge to listen on 0.0.0.0 instead of localhost
- ✓ Completed: Create session documentation
- ✓ Completed: Document local testing procedure in Unity Editor
- ⏳ Pending: Test connection from WSL Claude Code

**Issue Reported**: Port 6400 is already in use. Ensure no other instances are running or change the port.

**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. Check if Unity Editor already has an instance of Unity MCP Bridge running
2. Look for other processes using port 6400:
   - Windows: `netstat -ano | findstr :6400`
   - WSL/Linux: `sudo lsof -i :6400` or `netstat -tulpn | grep 6400`
3. Stop any existing Unity MCP Bridge instances in Unity Editor
4. If needed, restart Unity Editor to ensure clean state
5. Alternative: Consider making the port configurable in future updates

### Update - 2025-01-25 12:15 PM
**Model**: Opus 4 - coding work

**Summary**: Enhanced WSL support for Unity MCP Server with automatic Windows host IP detection and environment variable configuration

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: UnityMcpServer/src/config.py (added automatic Windows host IP detection)
- Modified: README.md (added WSL troubleshooting section)
- Added: UnityMcpServer/src/test_connection.py (connection testing utility)
- Current branch: master (commit: 3ec7a84)

**Todo Progress**: Session tasks not tracked with TodoWrite tool

**Details**: 
- Implemented automatic Windows host IP detection for WSL environments
- Added support for UNITY_HOST and WSL_INTEROP_IP environment variables
- Created intelligent fallback system: WSL_INTEROP_IP → default gateway → nameserver → localhost
- Added comprehensive WSL troubleshooting section to README
- Created test_connection.py utility for verifying Unity Editor connectivity
- Confirmed Tailscale IP (100.112.45.43) works reliably for WSL-to-Windows connection

**Configuration Options Added**:
1. Environment variable override: `export UNITY_HOST=<ip-address>`
2. WSL-specific override: `export WSL_INTEROP_IP=<ip-address>`
3. Automatic detection via ip route and /etc/resolv.conf parsing

**Future Enhancement Requested**: 
User requests MCP client configuration updates to support WSL-specific options that can be configured via `claude mcp add` and `claude mcp add-json` commands, allowing easy IP configuration for WSL environments
